Anovas are used to test groups to see if there’s a difference between them
One Way Anova: Compares impact of one independent categorical variable on a numeric outcome
Two Way Anova: Compares impact of two independent categorical variables on a numeric outcome 

##### One Way Anovas #####
#A one way ANOVA is used to compare two means from two independent (unrelated) groups using the F-distribution. 
#Null Hypothsis: That the two means are equal and there is no difference between Groups 
#Significant Result: If the two means are unequal.

#Example Leg Strength According to Weight 
#Independent Variable: Leg Strength 
#Dependent Group: Weight
#Dependent Levels: Underweight, Average Weight, Overweight 

#Limits & Further Testing
#Limits: F-Statistic will tell you at least two groups were different from each other. But it won’t tell you which groups were different. 
#Further Test: Least significant difference to show which groups had different means 

##### Two Way Anovas #####
#Example Leg Strength According to Weight & Age Group 
Independent Variable: Leg Strength 
Dependent Group: Weight
Dependent Levels: Underweight, Average Weight, Overweight 
Dependent Group2: Age Group 
Depedent Levels2: Children, Teens, Adults, Seniors 

#Outputs: 
#When working with Anovas the following tests should be used

#Tukeys 
#Kruskall Wallace: Medians 
#Randomization Tests:
