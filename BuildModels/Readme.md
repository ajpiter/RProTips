## Prediction Models 

**ANOVA**: Predicts continous outcome based on categorical values 

**Regression**: Predicts continous outcome based on continous values 

## Types of Machine Learning Models 

#### Before you can begin to create models you need to understand what models are available and which work best for which problems. There have been many books written on the subject, and at somepoint I should probably add my notes to reference later. For now the best quick explination is the visual below.

In addition to my Github notes below are book & online course recommendations for the various models. 

## Supervised Learning 

### Linear Networks (Most Common) 
1. **Practical Statistics for Data Science:** Almost an entire book devoted to regression and linear modeling. Covers concepts you forgot from stats class and how to implement in R or Python. From correlation, to sampling to accessing the model and cross validation.

### Decision Tress 

### Neural Networks (Excluding Linear) 
#### Recurrent Neural Networks 
#### Conditional Neural Networks 
#### Dense Neural Networks 

### Support Vector Machines 

## Unsupervised Learning 

### Clustering 
#### K-Means Clustering (Most Common) 

#### Density Based Special Clustering with Noise (DBSCAN) 

### Dimensionality Reduction 

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 

### Associate Rule Learning
